        "# The NextMind Dev Kit is a brain-computer interface (BCI) development kit designed to enable developers to create applications controlled by brain signals, specifically targeting signals from the visual cortex. A graphical user interface (GUI) for this kit would be a critical tool, providing developers with an intuitive and powerful platform to design, test, and debug their BCI applications. Below is a comprehensive overview of what such a GUI might include, tailored to the needs of developers working with this innovative technology.\n",
        "# Key Components of the GUI\n",
        "# Signal Visualization Dashboard\n",
        "# Purpose: Monitor and interpret brain signals in real-time.\n",

        "# Real-time waveform display of EEG signals.\n",
        "# Heatmaps or topographic maps to visualize brain activity.\n",
        "# Filtering options to focus on specific frequency bands (e.g., alpha, beta waves).\n",
        "# Benefit: Helps developers understand raw data and refine signal processing for their applications.\n",
